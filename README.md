<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
- You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

- [![Typescript][Typescript]][Typescript-url]

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- node v17.8.0
  ```sh
  npm install node@v17.8.0
  ```
- If you already have node installed on your machine, you must change the version after executing the previous command.
  ```sh
  nvm use v17.8.0
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ana2877/Expenses.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

### How to run the project and basic scripts

- To run the project:
    ```sh
    npm run start 
    ```

    Runs the app in the development mode.\
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

    The page will reload if you make edits.\
    You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- To test the code:
    ```sh
    npm run test
    ```
    Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- To lint the code:
    ```sh
    npm run lint
    ```
    Check if the code is within the eslint rules.

### Cypress

Remember to run the project in another terminal before running these commands. We need to do this because the e2e tests are done by accessing the website in the browser by the url.
- To run the tests hiding the browser:
    ```sh
    npm run cy 
    ```
  
    It is only going to run in your terminal and not open anything else.
  

- To run the tests displaying the browser:
    ```sh
    npm run cy:headed
    ```
  
    It is going to open the browser displaying all the tests.

- To open the cypress:
    ```sh
    npm run cy:open
    ```
    Opens Cypress and runs it until you finish the process. Here you have a lot of functionalities, like checking all the tests you have and running specific tests however many times you like.
