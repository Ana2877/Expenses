Technical Frontend:
- enhance husky -> create a commit pattern maybe
- check if it is possible to use a visual regression test (lambda test?)
- pipeline
- create storybook for other components
- create a shared context for storybook so we don't have to call all the providers and dependencies before the component. Ex: Routes.

Technical Backend -> waiting until frontend is more concrete

General ->
- Update readme with storybook info
- Update readme with husky info
- Update readme with project info

System:
- User Login
- User Profile -> What is the plan the user is currently assigned
- Schedule -> User can schedule a free time
- Admin is a user that can add the times for students to pick
- Available Plans -> User can update its plan. Like two hours per week and prices or hire a plan.



Done:
- install husky
- install storybook
- added a readme template
- create scripts to cypress: 
    - run all tests without open the chrome browser
    - open cypress
