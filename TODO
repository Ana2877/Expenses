Technical Frontend:
- create scripts to cypress: 
    - run all tests without open the chrome browser
    - open cypress
- install storybook
- enhance husky -> create a commit pattern maybe
- check if it is possible to use a visual regression test (lambda test?)
- pipeline

Technical Backend -> waiting until frontend is more concrete
