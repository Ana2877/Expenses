Technical Frontend:
- create scripts to cypress: 
    - run all tests without open the chrome browser
    - open cypress
- enhance husky -> create a commit pattern maybe
- check if it is possible to use a visual regression test (lambda test?)
- pipeline
- create storybook for other components
- create a shared context for storybook so we don't have to call all the providers and dependencies before the component. Ex: Routes.
- update the readme

Technical Backend -> waiting until frontend is more concrete

System:
- User Login
- User Profile -> Income, how much he intends to save
- Scheduler -> User can add scheduler with price, date and category
- Plannings -> User can add items that he plans to purchase
- Graphs -> Graphs showing the total money spent per month, graphs showing money spend per category in the last month




Done:
- install husky
- install storybook
